      <div class="card">
        <p>
          The Harbin Ice and Snow Festival is one of the largest winter festivals in the world, held every year in Harbin, a city in northeastern China. It draws visitors from across the globe to experience a city transformed into a sparkling frozen wonderland. The festival begins in early January and runs until late February, when the sub-zero temperatures keep the massive ice and snow sculptures intact. Over the years, it has grown from a small local event into an international attraction, blending art, culture, and winter sports into a unique experience.

      <h2>Ice Sculptures</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
The festival is famous for its enormous ice and snow sculptures, created by skilled artists who carve blocks of ice from the Songhua River. These sculptures range from majestic castles and temples to detailed replicas of world landmarks. At night, thousands of LED lights illuminate the sculptures, casting colorful reflections and creating an almost magical atmosphere. Some sculptures are interactive, allowing visitors to walk inside ice buildings or slide down ice slides, making the experience immersive and unforgettable.

      <h2>Plan Your Visit</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
Harbin is located in Heilongjiang Province, northeastern China, and is known for its extremely cold winters. The best time to visit the festival is in January, when the ice sculptures are at their peak and temperatures can drop below −20°C, ensuring the frozen creations remain solid. Visitors are advised to wear heavy winter clothing, including thermal layers, hats, gloves, and insulated boots, to stay comfortable while exploring the outdoor attractions. Local hotels, restaurants, and guided tours make it easy for international tourists to enjoy the festival safely and fully.
